# Community Detection in Multilayered Graph using Social Network Analysis

This project focuses on identifying communities in multilayered graphs by applying social network analysis techniques. It aims to uncover hidden structures within complex, interconnected networks, where multiple types of relationships exist between entities.

## Features
- **Multilayered Graph Analysis**: Detect communities in networks with multiple layers representing different types of relationships.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Apply algorithms to uncover communities based on node centrality, clustering, and network modularity.
- **Visual Representation**: Visualize the structure of communities using network graphs.
